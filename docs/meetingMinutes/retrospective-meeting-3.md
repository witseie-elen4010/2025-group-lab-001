Date: Monday, 26 May 2025
Time: 15:40

Attendance:
All group members were in attendance

## User Stories
- A total of four stories were completed during the sprint.
- It was decided that two of the user stories initially defined would be removed due to time constraints.

## Problems
- Jess and Rameez both noted that the implementation of SQL was done too late which caused many features to function incorrectly and resulted in some features being obsolete.
- Nnete felt that the overall time management of all group members were poor.
- Siya remarked that the project appears to be rushed as it work for it was only done near the deadlines.
- It was put forward by Jess that the group experienced scope creep in the sense that the major functionality of the game was built within the first sprint and the subsequent releases were sub-par.

## Successes
- All group members were impressed with the graphics of the game.
- Jess was happy that the cursor for the game was unique.
- Rameez was satisfied with the overall functionality of the accounts.
- Nnete expressed that all members had a passion for the project and the team had a vision for the project which all members strived for.

## Ideas for improvement
- It was put forward by Jess that in future projects, the database should be handled earlier as it ties in with many things.
- Nnete was of the opinion that members should try to be more honest with themselves in terms of time management and allocation, and communicate this to the other members for better planning purposes.
- Siya believed that starting earlier and working more consistently would have vastly improved the overall performance.
