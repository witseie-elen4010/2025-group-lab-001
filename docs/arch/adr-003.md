# ADR-003: Use of Standard JavaScript and Code Review Convention

## Status
Accepted

## Context
To ensure consistency and maintainability in the project, it is important to define a standard for JavaScript usage and establish a convention for conducting code reviews.

## Decision
1. **JavaScript Standard**: The project will use [Standard JavaScript](https://standardjs.com/) as the coding style guide. This ensures a consistent style across the codebase and reduces friction during development.

2. **Code Review Convention**: 
   - The project will adopt **Google's Code Review Guidelines** as the formal code review style.
   - All pull requests must be reviewed by at least one team member before merging.
   - Reviewers should focus on:
     - Adherence to the Standard JavaScript style guide.
     - Code readability and maintainability.
     - Proper use of comments and documentation.
     - Identification of potential bugs or performance issues.
   - Use clear and constructive feedback during reviews.

## Consequences
- Developers must install and configure tools to enforce Standard JavaScript (e.g., linters).
- Code reviews will follow the defined convention to ensure quality and consistency.
- Team members should familiarize themselves with **Google's Code Review Guidelines** to ensure alignment with the adopted style.
