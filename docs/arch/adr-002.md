# ADR 2: The use of WebSockets (Socket.io) for live updates 

## Context
The game is based on a client-server architecture and involves multiple clients interacting simultaneously. To ensure a smooth and responsive user experience, the server needs to send live updates to clients about the actions of other clients in real time. The site also needs to be able
to support multiple games simultaneously. 

We considered the following options for implementing live updates:
1. **HTTP Polling**: Clients periodically send requests to the server to check for updates.
2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: The server sends one-way updates to clients over a persistent connection.
3. **WebSockets**: A bidirectional communication protocol that allows both the client and server to send messages to each other over a single persistent connection.

After evaluating these options, we decided to use **WebSockets** (via the Socket.io library) for live updates.

## Decision
We will use **WebSockets** (Socket.io) for implementing live updates in the game.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences

### Benefits of Choosing WebSockets
1. **Bidirectional Communication**: WebSockets allow both the client and server to send messages to each other in real time, which is essential for a game where clients need to interact dynamically.
2. **Low Latency**: WebSockets provide low-latency communication compared to HTTP polling, ensuring a smoother and more responsive gaming experience.
3. **Efficient Resource Usage**: Unlike HTTP polling, which requires frequent requests and responses, WebSockets maintain a single persistent connection, reducing network overhead and server load.
4. **Scalability**: WebSockets are well-suited for applications with multiple clients requiring real-time updates, such as multiplayer games.
5. **Socket.io Features**: The Socket.io library simplifies WebSocket implementation and provides additional features like automatic reconnection, event-based communication, and support for fallback options (e.g., long polling).
6. **Support for Multiple Games**: WebSockets (via Socket.io) make it easier to host multiple games simultaneously. Using features like rooms or namespaces, each game session can be isolated, ensuring that updates and interactions are scoped to the relevant players without interference between games.

### Drawbacks of Choosing WebSockets
1. **Complexity**: Implementing WebSockets is more complex than HTTP polling or SSE, requiring additional effort for setup and debugging.
2. **Server Load**: Maintaining persistent connections for multiple clients can increase server resource usage, especially for large-scale applications.
3. **Compatibility**: While WebSockets are widely supported, some older browsers or network configurations may not fully support them. However, Socket.io mitigates this by providing fallback options.

### Why Not HTTP Polling?
1. **High Latency**: HTTP polling introduces delays between updates, as clients must wait for the next polling interval to receive new data.
2. **Inefficient Resource Usage**: Frequent requests and responses increase network traffic and server load.
3. **Unidirectional Communication**: HTTP polling is client-initiated and does not allow the server to push updates to clients in real time.

### Why Not Server-Sent Events (SSE)?
1. **Unidirectional Communication**: SSE only allows the server to send updates to the client, which is insufficient for a game requiring bidirectional communication.
2. **Limited Browser Support**: SSE is not supported in some environments, such as older versions of Internet Explorer.
3. **Scalability**: SSE is less efficient than WebSockets for handling a large number of simultaneous connections.

### Final Consideration
WebSockets (via Socket.io) provide the best balance of features, performance, and scalability for the game's requirements. While the implementation is more complex, the benefits of bidirectional, low-latency communication outweigh the drawbacks. This decision ensures a responsive and engaging experience for players in the game.

By choosing WebSockets, we can efficiently handle real-time updates and interactions between multiple clients, and the use of rooms or namespaces allows us to host multiple games simultaneously without interference. This makes WebSockets the ideal solution for this project.
