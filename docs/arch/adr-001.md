# ADR 1: The use of SQL Server over MongoDB

## Context
The game requires persistent data storage for user accounts, game progress, and other related data. The team has the option to use either MySQL (a relational database) or MongoDB (a NoSQL database). The team is more familiar with MySQL, which influences the decision. Additionally, the nature of the data being stored (structured and relational) aligns well with the capabilities of a relational database.

## Decision
We will be making use of MySQL for all persistent data storage within the application.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
### Benefits of Choosing MySQL
1. **Familiarity**: The team has prior experience with MySQL, which reduces the learning curve and allows for faster development and debugging.
2. **Structured Data**: MySQL is well-suited for structured, relational data, such as user accounts and game progress, which can be represented in tables with clear relationships.
3. **ACID Compliance**: MySQL provides strong ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees, ensuring data integrity, which is critical for user-related data in the game.
4. **Mature Ecosystem**: MySQL has a mature ecosystem with extensive documentation, tools, and community support, making it easier to integrate and maintain.
5. **Querying Capabilities**: SQL provides powerful querying capabilities, which are useful for retrieving and analyzing data efficiently. 

### Drawbacks of Choosing MySQL
1. **Scalability**: MySQL may face challenges with horizontal scaling compared to MongoDB, which is designed for distributed systems.
2. **Flexibility**: MySQL requires a predefined schema, which can make it less flexible for handling unstructured or rapidly changing data.

### Benefits of MongoDB (Not Chosen)
1. **Schema Flexibility**: MongoDB's schema-less design allows for greater flexibility in handling unstructured or semi-structured data.
2. **Horizontal Scalability**: MongoDB is designed for distributed systems and can scale horizontally more easily than MySQL.
3. **JSON-Like Documents**: MongoDB stores data in a JSON-like format, which can be more intuitive for developers working with modern web applications.

### Drawbacks of MongoDB
1. **Learning Curve**: The team has limited experience with MongoDB, which would require additional time for learning and adapting.
2. **Consistency**: MongoDB uses eventual consistency in some configurations, which may not be ideal for the strict consistency requirements of user-related data.
3. **Querying**: While MongoDB has powerful querying capabilities, they may not match the complexity and optimization of SQL for relational data.

### Final Consideration
Given the structured nature of the data, the team's familiarity with MySQL, and the need for strong consistency guarantees, MySQL is the better choice for this project. While MongoDB offers advantages in scalability and flexibility, these are not critical requirements for the current scope of the application.

By choosing MySQL, we ensure that the team can work efficiently and deliver a reliable solution for the game's data storage needs.
